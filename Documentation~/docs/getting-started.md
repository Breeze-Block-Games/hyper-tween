# Getting Started

To use this package as the base for another package:

* Create a fork of the repository in GitHub.
* Clone the forked repository
* Use the [fork-tools](https://github.com/Breeze-Block-Games/fork-tools) package to automatically rename and rewrite
files to use the name of your new package. This tool also rewrites Unity meta file guids which is extremely important
for avoiding duplicate guids when referencing multiple packages in a project.
